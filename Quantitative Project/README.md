<h1><b>Is The World In Need Of More Skilled Health Personnel?</b></h1>
<h4>Would higher numbers of skilled health personnel lead to higher to lower maternal mortality ratio?</h4>

<h4>1. Motivation</h4>
<p> “When women can decide whether and when to have children, it saves lives, promotes health, expands education, creates prosperity—no matter what country in the world you’re talking about.” ― Melinda Gates, The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World.</p>

<h4>2. Explorations </h4>

<p>What is the relationship of these 2 data sets? In other words, how does the availability of skilled health personnel affect safety 
and lives of maternal women?</p>

<h4>3. Process </h4>
<p><b>Initial Sketch</b></p>
<p> - How can I compare and contrast different countries to draw a connection of how skilled health personnel affect maternal mortality rate? </p>
<p> - What variables/ visual elements should I use to create a clear visualization of the relationship? </p>

<p><b>High-fidelity design prototype</b></p>

<h4>4. Next Steps: </h4>
<p>Explore a way to apply textures to the map to represent mortality rate.

<p>Adding interactive cards to show data details</p>
<p>Making the legends clickable and let users study the data visualization in their own way</p>
<p>Question: GEOJSON?</p>
